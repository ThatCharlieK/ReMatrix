# RowReducer
This library row takes a matrix and row reduces it. For example, the following code reduces an example matrix.
```py
import row_reducer
example_matrix = [[8, 2, 3, 4],
          [5, 3, 7, 8],
          [7, 9, 2, 5]]
row_reducer.row_reduce_matrix(example_matrix)
print(example_matrix)
```
